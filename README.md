# AI Interview Preparation Web Application

This web application helps users prepare for both technical and non-technical job interviews with a focus on improving their performance in real-world scenarios. It offers interactive simulations, including posture analysis, eye contact detection, and fluent responses scoring, along with AI-assisted group discussion features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Models**: Python

## Features

### 1. **Technical and Non-Technical Interviews**
   - Prepare for both technical coding interviews and non-technical HR interviews.
   - Customizable mock interviews with questions designed to simulate real-world interview scenarios.

### 2. **Sitting Posture and Position Analysis**
   - Real-time analysis of your sitting posture and position during the interview.
   - AI-driven feedback to improve body language and overall presentation.

### 3. **Eye Contact Detection**
   - Machine learning model detects eye contact while answering questions.
   - Provides feedback on maintaining proper eye contact to improve confidence and engagement during interviews.

### 4. **Fluency Scoring**
   - Real-time scoring of your fluency and coherence in answering questions.
   - Feedback on speech patterns, pauses, and clarity of thought.

### 5. **In-Built Code Editor for Technical Interviews**
   - Integrated code editor to practice technical questions.
   - Supports multiple programming languages for coding assessments during interviews.

### 6. **Group Discussion Simulator**
   - Simulates a group discussion with multiple AI agents discussing a given topic.
   - Provides an immersive environment for practicing group communication skills and handling opposing arguments.

## Machine Learning Models

- We have developed custom machine learning models to power the features listed above. These models are trained on large datasets to ensure accurate and real-time feedback for users.

### Key Models:
1. **Posture and Position Model**: Uses computer vision techniques to analyze and give feedback on sitting posture.
2. **Eye Contact Detection Model**: Analyzes webcam input to assess and track eye contact.
3. **Fluency Scoring Model**: Utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) to evaluate fluency, coherence, and speech patterns.
4. **Group Discussion Simulation Model**: AI-driven dialogue model that simulates conversations with diverse points of view.
